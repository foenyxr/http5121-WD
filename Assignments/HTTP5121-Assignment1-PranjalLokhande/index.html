            <p>
                While browsing here and there on YouTube, a tutorial video for creating Cinematic 3D film with Unreal Engine 5 by Dusty PIxels 
                inspired me to make a short film/cinematic. I instantly started noting down any idea that came to my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                I imported the model (.fbx) in Blender, modified it a little and exported it to use it in Unreal Engine. 
                There are two ways to import the fbx models using the FBX import settings; applying the texture materials to the model 
                in Blender (best for skeletal meshes and animations) and then export it OR applying the texture materials to the model 
                in the engine itself. I went with the latter.
            </p>

            <p>
                While importing the textures, the engine crashed multiple times. I was able to fix it by simply changing the default 
                graphics RHI to DirectX 11 and increasing texture streaming pool to 3000 mb (this may vary depending on the system) using the command:
            </p>

            <div>
                <code>r.Streaming.PoolSize = 3000</code>
            </div>

            <p>Below is the models import setting which made my life much easier.</p>

            <p>
                The model looked good enough to apply the textures. I looked for and tried multiple solutions to not apply individual textures manually, 
                but figured this was the best and least time-consuming method for me. <i>*cries on my chair because UE crashes*</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                I definitely liked how it turned out, at least for now. The next step was to make a Metahuman character using the Metahuman creator and setting it up in the project. This will be covered in the next part of the blog.
